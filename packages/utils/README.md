# Utils Library

This sub repo contains utility functions and helpers used throughout the various apps. Try to keep this package light and _only_ code that's shared.

## Types

Feel free to add shared types here as well. However, make sure they're imported in a separately from the main package to reduce bundle size.

## Bundler

This package uses [microbundle](https://github.com/developit/microbundle) bundle and package the goods. You can build the package using via: `yarn build`. If you want to build and watch the files for new changes, use: `yarn build:dev`.

## For contributers

Keep the dependency list extremely lean, please 🙏.
